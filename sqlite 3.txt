To install or upgrade sqlite3 to a specific version using apt, you may need to follow these steps, depending on the version available in your system's package repository.

1. Check Available Version in Your Repository
Run the following command to see the latest SQLite version available in your current repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt policy sqlite3
This will show the installed version and the candidate version available for installation.

2. Install the Latest Version from the Default Repository
If the desired version (e.g., 3.35 or higher) is available in your system's repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3
After installation, verify the version:

bash
Copy
Edit
sqlite3 --version
3. Add a Newer Repository (if required)
If your default repository doesn't provide the required version, add a PPA that includes a newer version of SQLite. For Ubuntu-based systems:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3
4. Manually Install SQLite (if version is still outdated)
If the package manager doesn't offer the required version, install it manually:

a) Download the Source Code
Visit the SQLite Download Page and copy the link to the latest source tarball (e.g., sqlite-autoconf-3410200.tar.gz for SQLite 3.41.2).

b) Install Build Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libreadline-dev
c) Compile and Install SQLite
bash
Copy
Edit
wget https://www.sqlite.org/2025/sqlite-autoconf-3410200.tar.gz
tar xzvf sqlite-autoconf-3410200.tar.gz
cd sqlite-autoconf-3410200
./configure
make
sudo make install
d) Verify Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
sqlite3 --version
5. Ensure Python Uses the New SQLite
Run the following in Python to confirm the updated version:

python
Copy
Edit
import sqlite3
print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)
If Python is still using an older SQLite version, you may need to rebuild or reinstall Python. Let me know if you need help with that! ðŸ˜Š
